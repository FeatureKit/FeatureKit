# Code of Conduct

The code of conduct governs how we behave and interact with each other. It is expected to be honoured by everyone who represents, claims affiliation with, or participates directly with the project.

We strive to:

* **Be open:** Anybody is invited to participate in any aspect of this project. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by any contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.
* **Be empathetic:** We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. By understanding humanity drops a few packets in online interactions, and adjusting accordingly, we can create a comfortable environment for everyone to share and contribute their ideas.
* **Be collaborative:** We prefer to work transparently and to involve interested parties early on in the process. Wherever possible, we work closely with others in the open source community to coordinate our efforts.
* **Be decisive:** We expect participants to resolve disagreements constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to structures with designated leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.
* **Be responsible:** We hold ourselves accountable for our actions. When we make mistakes, we take responsibility for them. When we need help, we reach out to others. When it comes time to relinquish involvement, we take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where we left off.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.
